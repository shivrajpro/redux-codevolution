Purpose of Exra Reducers
 1. In basic-redux project lets say we need to add a feature where an icecream
 is given free on purchase of cake. In this case, we need to add CAKE_ORDERED action in 
 iceCreamReducer which decrements the numOfIceCreams on CAKE_ORDERED action

 2. to implement the same feature in redux-toolkit, we need to add extraReducers key and 
    cake/ordered action in iceCreamSlice
